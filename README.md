# where-to-eat

The point of this application is to help anyone who is trying to decide on a place
to eat. It will take in multiple places to eat, and will spit out a random option.

I am now beginning to work on it making it have google maps API so the user can see
places near them as well as get their location upon going to the web page to better
assist with locations.
